"Don't look for patterns, look mainly for stocks that actually have a reasonable chance to keep going up...you obviously need a combination of momentum & relative strength, and something that's driving it, it may be earnings, it may be a hot theme...something like that, keep out of random stocks... –– Qullamaggie"
"How much does fundamentals or story matter? Qullamaggie - Hard to say but probably 50%. You wanna be in the things where money is gonna go to....and when I say fundamentals I'm not talking about like balance sheets and margins, I'm talking about like the theme or story."
I prefer to be either in a really hot sector or just in the growth names... – Qullamaggie
"Even if you get a good setup on a random stock, it's probably not worth it. Especially if you can choose from like these growth stocks...like if you have plenty of growth stocks and then you have some random stocks, focus on the growth stocks, because earnings are fuel. – Qullamaggie"
"You need a reason for something to go up, stocks don't go up just because there's a certain pattern to it, ok? You find the stocks that have a reason to go up and then you look for patterns on those stocks, because patterns are just something that can increase your odds of success and maximize your risk/reward. – Qullamaggie"
It's kinda hard to buy it if only like 1 stock in the sector is running... - Qullamaggie
"If you wanna make big money in the markets you have to stick to the momentum leaders, you have to stick to the best ones. You can't sit there and trade second and third-grade stocks. – Qullamaggie"
Markets have changed since I originally developed Episodic Pivots method. Originally it was focused on earnings plays. In last 24 years market does not care much about profits. sales growth is more important driver. besides that just stories and themes matter more and attract more money than stocks with good earnings. Real money now is in story EP - Stockbee
"The way a company can achieve enormous success, thereby enjoying large gains in its stock price, is by introducing dramatic new products into the marketplace. I’m not talking about a new formula for dish soap. I’m talking about products that revolutionize the way we live. - William O'Neil. Ex: The 1st transcontinental railroad, commercial radio, the TV, rocket fuel, the oral contraceptive pill, biotech drugs, the phone, the personal computer, the iPod, AI, etc. – Suggested by Charlie M (Twitter)"
"In our models of the 600 best-performing stocks from 1952-2001, three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances. - William O'Neil "
"From 1910-1950, most of the very best performers showed quarterly earnings gains ranging from 40% to 400% before their big price moves. - William O'Neil "
"The annual rate of earnings growth for the companies you pick should be 25%, 50%, or even 100% or more. Between 1980-2000, the median annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks in our study at their early emerging stage was 36%. - William O'Neil "
"37% of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in. Another 12% is due to strength in its overall sector. Therefore, half of a stock’s move is due to the strength of its respective group. - William O'Neil "
"The top one, two, or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir. - William O'Neil "
You should buy the really great companies – those that lead their industries and are number one in their particular fields. All my biggest winners…were the number one companies in their industry space at the time I purchased them. - William O'Neil 
"By number one, I don’t mean the largest company or the one with the most recognized brand name. I mean the one with the best quarterly and annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit margins, the strongest sales growth, and the most dynamic stock-price action. - William O'Neil "
Groups that emerge as leaders in a new bull market cycle can be found by observing unusual strength in one or two Nasdaq stocks and relating that strength to similar power in a listed stock in the same group. - William O'Neil 
"From the early 1950s through 2008, the average RS Rating of the best-performing stocks before their major run-ups was 87. In other words, the best stocks were already doing better than nearly 9 out of 10 others when they were starting out on their most explosive advance yet. - William O'Neil "
"You can be right on every one of the factors in the last six chapters, but if you’re wrong about the direction of the general market, and that direction is down, three out of four of your stocks will plummet along with the market averages, and you will lose money big time… - William O'Neil "
"If the original market leaders begin to falter, and lower-priced, lower-quality, more-speculative stocks begin to move up, watch out! When the old dogs begin to bark, the market is on its last feeble leg. Laggards can’t lead the market higher. Among the telltale signs are the poor-quality stocks that start to dominate the most-active list on market “up” days. This is simply a matter of weak leadership trying to command the market. If the best ones can’t lead, the worst certainly aren’t going to do so for very long. - William O'Neil "
"“If you are new to the stock market or the historically tested & proven strategies outlined in this book, or, more importantly, if you are reading this book for the first time near the beginning or middle of a bear market, do not expect the presumed buy patterns to work. Most of them will definitely be defective. You absolutely do not buy breakouts during a bear market. Most of them will fail. - William O'Neil "
It's the same patterns occurring over and over and over again. There's really no rocket science involved to make millions in the market. All you have to do is learn the setups and patiently wait for them. - Qullamaggie
"I tried to detect those stocks that resisted the decline. I reasoned that if they could swim against the stream, they were the ones that would advance the most rapidly when the current changed. - Nicholas Darvas"
"“I don’t really like buying stuff when there are not many setups because in a good market, there’s a lot of setups, you have to pass on things left and right - Qullamaggie"

"Often money that is just sitting can later be moved into the right situation at the right time and make a vast fortune-patience, patience, patience is the key to success... - Jesse Livermore"
"You only need one bull market to get rich, and change your financial futures. You only need one. Learn the setups, learn how stocks move, learn what moves stocks, and memorize the patterns. You only need one bull market to change your finances forever.- Qullamaggie"
"I pass on like 90% or 80% of all the trades I see...I try to take the ones that I feel the most comfortable with, but sometimes you gotta take the trades that feel uncomfortable. -Qullamaggie on April 2nd, 2017"
"In general, 3 to 4 to as many as 8 to 10 industry groups or subgroups lead a new bull market. - Minervini"
The industry groups with a healthy number of stocks hitting new highs early in a bull market will often be the leaders. Your portfolio should consist of the best companies in the top four or five sectors. - Minervini
How do you find which groups are leading? Follow the individual stocks. - Minervini
" I tend to let individual stocks lead me to into an industry group or sector, taking more of a bottom-up approach as opposed to top-down. - Minervini"
Stick to the strongest industries and pick out the strongest stocks in those industry groups - Jesse Livermore
The main challenge is to identify the current leaders and to spot the new leaders who are waiting to take over from the current existing leaders. During major shifts and changes in market direction it is of paramount importance to observe the leaders that are being driven out and identify the new leading stocks that will assume the leadership in the future. - Jesse Livermore
I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of the utmost discrimination in the purchase of securities by first examining Industry Groups. Stay away from weak groups! - Jesse Livermore
Understanding industry group action is essential to successful trading. - Jesse Livermore
The most intelligent way to get one's mind attuned to market conditions and to be successful is to make a deep study of Industry Groups in order to distinguish the good groups from the bad: get long those which are in a promising position and get out of those Industry Groups which are not. - Jesse Livermore
"Just as I would avoid the weak stocks in the weak industries, I would favor the strongest stocks in the strongest industries.  - Jesse Livermore"
"However, that didn't mean he would buy any stock if it was in a strong sector. Livermore said, I also believe in trading the market leader, go with the most powerful stock in the group-don't look for the bargain, the weak sister, go with the leader, the anchor, the strongest stock in the group.  - Jesse Livermore"
"It was Livermore's experience that group behavior is an important key to overall market direction, and that groups often provided the key to changes in trends. As favored groups got weaker & collapsed, it usually foretold a correction in the market. This is how he called the market turn in 1907 and 1929. The leaders rolled over first. Jesse Livermore, How To Trade In Stocks"
"“37% of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in. Another 12% is due to strength in its overall sector. Therefore, half of a stock’s move is due to the strength of its respective group.” – William O’Neil"
One thing that corrections taught me is that the BIGGEST gains come after corrections. - Qullamaggie
"“It's about the big picture...if you study thousands of stocks you will know that the big winners, they will surf the 10 and 20 day for weeks and months on end...if there is no close beyond the 10 or 20, why should you sell it?” - Qullamaggie"
"Everyone thinks they can make it in this game, very few do. Even fewer get rich. What are you doing different from the other 99%? What is your edge? Qullamaggie"
"Block out all the randomness in the markets, and laser focus on the momentum leaders. Leaders that have recent news, catalyst, or top dog earnings. That's what makes a stock go higher. Qullamaggie"
"If you wanna make big money in the markets you have to stick to the momo leaders, you have to stick to the best ones. You can't sit there and trade second and third-grade stocks. - Qullamaggie"
"You wanna be in the things where money is gonna go to....and when I say fundamentals I'm not talking about like balance sheets and margins, I'm talking about like the theme or story. Qullamaggie"
"The setups are timeless absolutely, but you’ve gotta identify when the setups are working and not working, that’s the hardest part, learning the setups is the easy part, you just have to put in some effort and you can very easily identify a 5star setup from a 3star setup. A beginner doesn’t see the difference but you put in a bit of effort and you will see the difference. But identifying periods and actually not trading during unfavourable periods that’s the hardest thing, that’s my biggest weakness overtrading, it’s very natural to start looking for trades when there’s not many good setups, especially coming off a period when there’s been good setups non stop, it’s a little bit hard to me to adapt sometimes, I keep pushing even when I shouldn’t, my returns would be much bigger if I didn’t do that. Qullamaggie"
Learning how to identify good setup is easy and you can do it in a few months with enough effort. Knowing when to push that setup and when to take a step back is hard and took me many years to be able to identify the clues the market gives constantly. Qullamaggie
"The biggest secret to the markets is there is no secret, just hard work. - Qullamaggie"

“The first step in learning to pick stock market winners is for you to examine leading winners of the past to learn all the characteristics of the most successful stocks.” - Qullamaggie
"A study published in June of almost 1,600 Brazilian day traders that tracked their activity for one year concluded that only 3% made money... Only 1.1% earned more than the Brazilian minimum wage and only 0.5% earned more than the initial salary of a bank teller (CNBC). An older study, going back to 2000 analyzed 66,000 trading accounts at Charles Schwab from 1991 to 1996. They found that those who traded the most earned an annual return of 11.4%, while the market overall returned 17.9%. Qullamaggie"
Main thing people lack is a setup. I trade 3 setups and I try to teach  mainly 1 of these setups on stream. (hint: you only need ONE solid setup to make 10s of millions). Then you need to know proper position and risk management. Then you need to know when these setups work/don't work. You also NEED to trade less and smaller size when conditions are not favorable. When conditions are favorable you need to step on the gas. You need to LEARN when conditions are favorable or not for a setup. -Qullamaggie 
"Also one last thing, to get to the big money you also need to be able to SCALE your trading. In the new Market Wizards book, the last chapter was about a guy whose trading account hadn't grown in 10 years. He had all of these concepts figured out except scaling up his trading. If you double your account (not by luck but by trading a solid setup and following your rules and risk management) you should eventually get your position sizes and absolute risk to a double too. It can take some time to get comfortable at a new level.-Qullamaggie"
"To answer my question What is your edge? My edge is trading 3 very specific setups that have worked for over 100+ years. how do I know this? I've spent thousands of hours studying charts and fundamentals. These setups occur over and over again when specific criteria are met. I trade those setups using specific position management of not putting more than 20-25% of my funds in any stock overnight, ever. Per trade risk is usually 0.2-0.5% of my funds, I rarely risk more than 1% on any trade. You don't need to risk more to make 100/200%+ per year. - Qullamaggie"
"A couple of weeks ago I lost $3M in an hour on the stream and it was annoying but nothing I lost sleep over. Huge sums in absolute terms, yes. But in relative terms just a regular drawdown. - Qullamaggie"
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to make it in trading but you can't be an idiot. -Qullamaggie
