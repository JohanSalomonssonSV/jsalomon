"Don't look for patterns, look mainly for stocks that actually have a reasonable chance to keep going up...you obviously need a combination of momentum & relative strength, and something that's driving it, it may be earnings, it may be a hot theme...something like that, keep out of random stocks...",Kristjan Kullamägi
"How much does fundamentals or story matter? Hard to say but probably 50%. You wanna be in the things where money is gonna go to....and when I say fundamentals I'm not talking about like balance sheets and margins, I'm talking about like the theme or story",Kristjan Kullamägi
I prefer to be either in a really hot sector or just in the growth names...,Kristjan Kullamägi
"Even if you get a good setup on a random stock, it's probably not worth it. Especially if you can choose from like these growth stocks...like if you have plenty of growth stocks and then you have some random stocks, focus on the growth stocks, because earnings are fuel.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"You need a reason for something to go up, stocks don't go up just because there's a certain pattern to it, ok? You find the stocks that have a reason to go up and then you look for patterns on those stocks, because patterns are just something that can increase your odds of success and maximize your risk/reward.",Kristjan Kullamägi
It's kinda hard to buy it if only like 1 stock in the sector is running...,Kristjan Kullamägi
"If you wanna make big money in the markets you have to stick to the momentum leaders, you have to stick to the best ones. You can't sit there and trade second and third-grade stocks.",Kristjan Kullamägi
Markets have changed since I originally developed Episodic Pivots method. Originally it was focused on earnings plays. In last 24 years market does not care much about profits. sales growth is more important driver. besides that just stories and themes matter more and attract more money than stocks with good earnings. Real money now is in story EP,Stockbee
"The way a company can achieve enormous success, thereby enjoying large gains in its stock price, is by introducing dramatic new products into the marketplace. I’m not talking about a new formula for dish soap. I’m talking about products that revolutionize the way we live. (Example: The 1st transcontinental railroad, commercial radio, the TV, rocket fuel, the oral contraceptive pill, biotech drugs, the phone, the personal computer, the iPod, AI, etc.  )",William O'Neil
"In our models of the 600 best-performing stocks from 1952-2001, three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances.",William O'Neil
"From 1910-1950, most of the very best performers showed quarterly earnings gains ranging from 40% to 400% before their big price moves.",William O'Neil
"The annual rate of earnings growth for the companies you pick should be 25%, 50%, or even 100% or more. Between 1980-2000, the median annual growth rate of all outstanding stocks in our study at their early emerging stage was 36%.",William O'Neil
"37% of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in. Another 12% is due to strength in its overall sector. Therefore, half of a stock’s move is due to the strength of its respective group.",William O'Neil
"The top one, two, or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir.",William O'Neil
You should buy the really great companies - those that lead their industries and are number one in their particular fields. All my biggest winners…were the number one companies in their industry space at the time I purchased them.,William O'Neil
"By number one, I don’t mean the largest company or the one with the most recognized brand name. I mean the one with the best quarterly and annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit margins, the strongest sales growth, and the most dynamic stock-price action.",William O'Neil
Groups that emerge as leaders in a new bull market cycle can be found by observing unusual strength in one or two Nasdaq stocks and relating that strength to similar power in a listed stock in the same group.,William O'Neil
"From the early 1950s through 2008, the average RS Rating of the best-performing stocks before their major run-ups was 87. In other words, the best stocks were already doing better than nearly 9 out of 10 others when they were starting out on their most explosive advance yet.",William O'Neil
"You can be right on every one of the factors in the last six chapters, but if you’re wrong about the direction of the general market, and that direction is down, three out of four of your stocks will plummet along with the market averages, and you will lose money big time…",William O'Neil
"If the original market leaders begin to falter, and lower-priced, lower-quality, more-speculative stocks begin to move up, watch out! When the old dogs begin to bark, the market is on its last feeble leg. Laggards can’t lead the market higher. Among the telltale signs are the poor-quality stocks that start to dominate the most-active list on market “up” days. This is simply a matter of weak leadership trying to command the market. If the best ones can’t lead, the worst certainly aren’t going to do so for very long.",William O'Neil
"“If you are new to the stock market or the historically tested & proven strategies outlined in this book, or, more importantly, if you are reading this book for the first time near the beginning or middle of a bear market, do not expect the presumed buy patterns to work. Most of them will definitely be defective. You absolutely do not buy breakouts during a bear market. Most of them will fail.",William O'Neil
It's the same patterns occurring over and over and over again. There's really no rocket science involved to make millions in the market. All you have to do is learn the setups and patiently wait for them.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"I tried to detect those stocks that resisted the decline. I reasoned that if they could swim against the stream, they were the ones that would advance the most rapidly when the current changed.",Nicholas Darvas
"“I don’t really like buying stuff when there are not many setups because in a good market, there’s a lot of setups, you have to pass on things left and right",Kristjan Kullamägi
"It's more than just buying a pattern. We gotta have themes, we gotta have groups, we gotta have big money behind us...",LeifSoreide
"Often money that is just sitting can later be moved into the right situation at the right time and make a vast fortune-patience, patience, patience is the key to success...",Jesse Livermore
"You only need one bull market to get rich, and change your financial futures. You only need one. Learn the setups, learn how stocks move, learn what moves stocks, and memorize the patterns. You only need one bull market to change your finances forever.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"I pass on like 90% or 80% of all the trades I see...I try to take the ones that I feel the most comfortable with, but sometimes you gotta take the trades that feel uncomfortable.","Kristjan Kullamägi on April 2nd, 2017"
"In general, 3 to 4 to as many as 8 to 10 industry groups or subgroups lead a new bull market.",Mark Minervini
The industry groups with a healthy number of stocks hitting new highs early in a bull market will often be the leaders. Your portfolio should consist of the best companies in the top four or five sectors.,Mark Minervini
How do you find which groups are leading? Follow the individual stocks.,Mark Minervini
"I tend to let individual stocks lead me to into an industry group or sector, taking more of a bottom-up approach as opposed to top-down.",Mark Minervini
Stick to the strongest industries and pick out the strongest stocks in those industry groups,Jesse Livermore
The main challenge is to identify the current leaders and to spot the new leaders who are waiting to take over from the current existing leaders. During major shifts and changes in market direction it is of paramount importance to observe the leaders that are being driven out and identify the new leading stocks that will assume the leadership in the future.,Jesse Livermore
I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of the utmost discrimination in the purchase of securities by first examining Industry Groups. Stay away from weak groups!,Jesse Livermore
Understanding industry group action is essential to successful trading.,Jesse Livermore
The most intelligent way to get one's mind attuned to market conditions and to be successful is to make a deep study of Industry Groups in order to distinguish the good groups from the bad: get long those which are in a promising position and get out of those Industry Groups which are not.,Jesse Livermore
"Just as I would avoid the weak stocks in the weak industries, I would favor the strongest stocks in the strongest industries.",Jesse Livermore
"However, that didn't mean he would buy any stock if it was in a strong sector. Livermore said, I also believe in trading the market leader, go with the most powerful stock in the group-don't look for the bargain, the weak sister, go with the leader, the anchor, the strongest stock in the group.",Jesse Livermore
"It was Livermore's experience that group behavior is an important key to overall market direction, and that groups often provided the key to changes in trends. As favored groups got weaker & collapsed, it usually foretold a correction in the market. This is how he called the market turn in 1907 and 1929. The leaders rolled over first.",Jesse Livermore
"37% of a stock’s price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in. Another 12% is due to strength in its overall sector. Therefore, half of a stock’s move is due to the strength of its respective group.",William O’Neil
One thing that corrections taught me is that the BIGGEST gains come after corrections.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"It's about the big picture...if you study thousands of stocks you will know that the big winners, they will surf the 10 and 20 day for weeks and months on end...if there is no close beyond the 10 or 20, why should you sell it?",Kristjan Kullamägi
"Everyone thinks they can make it in this game, very few do. Even fewer get rich. What are you doing different from the other 99%? What is your edge?",Kristjan Kullamägi
"Block out all the randomness in the markets, and laser focus on the momentum leaders. Leaders that have recent news, catalyst, or top dog earnings. That's what makes a stock go higher",Kristjan Kullamägi
"If you wanna make big money in the markets you have to stick to the momo leaders, you have to stick to the best ones. You can't sit there and trade second and third-grade stocks.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"You wanna be in the things where money is gonna go to....and when I say fundamentals I'm not talking about like balance sheets and margins, I'm talking about like the theme or story.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"The setups are timeless absolutely, but you’ve gotta identify when the setups are working and not working, that’s the hardest part, learning the setups is the easy part, you just have to put in some effort and you can very easily identify a 5star setup from a 3star setup. A beginner doesn’t see the difference but you put in a bit of effort and you will see the difference. But identifying periods and actually not trading during unfavourable periods that’s the hardest thing, that’s my biggest weakness overtrading, it’s very natural to start looking for trades when there’s not many good setups, especially coming off a period when there’s been good setups non stop, it’s a little bit hard to me to adapt sometimes, I keep pushing even when I shouldn’t, my returns would be much bigger if I didn’t do that.",Kristjan Kullamägi
Learning how to identify good setup is easy and you can do it in a few months with enough effort. Knowing when to push that setup and when to take a step back is hard and took me many years to be able to identify the clues the market gives constantly.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"The biggest secret to the markets is there is no secret, just hard work.",Kristjan Kullamägi
I have also done this research on every EP that had follow through the past 10-15 years & I encourage everyone to do this to gain conviction/confidence in these kinds of strategies.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"Always remember, while you do nothing in the market and prepare properly, the undisciplined are laying the foundation for your success.",Mark Minervini
"I want to hold stocks for as long as possible, I really don't want to sell them until I absolutely have to or feel like I have to...",Kristjan Kullamägi
The first step in learning to pick stock market winners is for you to examine leading winners of the past to learn all the characteristics of the most successful stocks.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"A study published in June of almost 1,600 Brazilian day traders that tracked their activity for one year concluded that only 3% made money... Only 1.1% earned more than the Brazilian minimum wage and only 0.5% earned more than the initial salary of a bank teller (CNBC). An older study, going back to 2000 analyzed 66,000 trading accounts at Charles Schwab from 1991 to 1996. They found that those who traded the most earned an annual return of 11.4%, while the market overall returned 17.9%.",Kristjan Kullamägi
Main thing people lack is a setup. I trade 3 setups and I try to teach  mainly 1 of these setups on stream. (hint: you only need ONE solid setup to make 10s of millions). Then you need to know proper position and risk management. Then you need to know when these setups work/don't work. You also NEED to trade less and smaller size when conditions are not favorable. When conditions are favorable you need to step on the gas. You need to LEARN when conditions are favorable or not for a setup.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"Also one last thing, to get to the big money you also need to be able to SCALE your trading. In the new Market Wizards book, the last chapter was about a guy whose trading account hadn't grown in 10 years. He had all of these concepts figured out except scaling up his trading. If you double your account (not by luck but by trading a solid setup and following your rules and risk management) you should eventually get your position sizes and absolute risk to a double too. It can take some time to get comfortable at a new level.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"To answer my question What is your edge? My edge is trading 3 very specific setups that have worked for over 100+ years. how do I know this? I've spent thousands of hours studying charts and fundamentals. These setups occur over and over again when specific criteria are met. I trade those setups using specific position management of not putting more than 20-25% of my funds in any stock overnight, ever. Per trade risk is usually 0.2-0.5% of my funds, I rarely risk more than 1% on any trade. You don't need to risk more to make 100/200%+ per year.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"A couple of weeks ago I lost $3M in an hour on the stream and it was annoying but nothing I lost sleep over. Huge sums in absolute terms, yes. But in relative terms just a regular drawdown.",Kristjan Kullamägi
You don't have to be a rocket scientist to make it in trading but you can't be an idiot.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"If you could only trade one setup, it should be the high-tight flag. You’re going to make so much money you don’t even know what to do.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"This is how stocks move. They look like stairs. You have a step higher, sideways, step higher, sideways. Your job is to buy at the exact moment that the next step higher is forming",Kristjan Kullamägi
"When the 10-day (moving average) and 20-day are rising, and the 10-day is above the 20-day, that’s when you get really good swing trading markets",Kristjan Kullamägi
You need to study thousands of stocks going back decades. Stocks move the same way today as they did a hundred years ago,Kristjan Kullamägi
You want to buy a stock as soon as it starts breaking the range.,Kristjan Kullamägi
Most traders trade on their/others opinion and feelings. Very few bother to actually find a setup that is part of the market structure that occurs over and over again. And even if they have a setup they lack the understanding under which market conditions that setup works,Kristjan Kullamägi
Never ever short day one. You’re going to save yourself so much money and headaches.,Kristjan Kullamägi
A couple of weeks or months of consolidation is the sweet spot.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"The fewer things you worry about, the better your trading will be.",Kristjan Kullamägi
A momentum leader is a stock that’s among the one or two percent of the biggest gainers.,Kristjan Kullamägi
Just because a stock went up doesn’t mean it had a good setup. A lot of stocks go up without showing good setups,Kristjan Kullamägi
"If it gaps up over the range, use the opening range highs. You can use the 1-minute, 5-minute, or 60-minute",Kristjan Kullamägi
Try to keep your stops around a third or half of the average daily range or average true range.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"If you’re getting confused with intraday charts, just use the daily chart.",Kristjan Kullamägi
It doesn’t matter if the stock goes up after you buy it. You need to buy a solid setup. You can’t chase.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"If you want to make it in this, you need to have very specific entries and very specific setups.",Kristjan Kullamägi
All you have to do is follow your setups and rules. There’s always someone doing something else,Kristjan Kullamägi
"Focus on quality setups. If you trade random setups, your results are going to be random too",Kristjan Kullamägi
Every stock is going to stop you out sooner or later. It’s when things pull back where we see which stocks are strong and which are not.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"No matter how high you think a stock can go, it can go higher. That’s why I always trail some",Kristjan Kullamägi
"I have no problem re-buying stocks, but only if it sets up again.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"It doesn’t matter how much you hate the company. If there’s a good setup on it. If there’s a 5-star setup, you have to buy.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"Understand the nuances of the setups. Understand when it works and when it doesn’t work, when you should be aggressive, and when you should be defensive. It takes years to get good at it.",Kristjan Kullamägi
It’s not about one or two trades. It’s about making hundreds and thousands of trades. It’s about consistency.,Kristjan Kullamägi
The best time to trade the breakout method is after a pullback in the market. You want to see which stock held up the most,Kristjan Kullamägi
It’s all about small losses and big winners.,Kristjan Kullamägi
Always think in percentages. I think that’s a very useful exercise that may take your trading to the next level.,Kristjan Kullamägi
Don’t start randomly picking tops. Wait for weakness.,Kristjan Kullamägi
Trade stocks that have volume and range. That’s where the money is.,Kristjan Kullamägi
You want to buy the first or second breakout.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"Sell a third or half after three to five days. Then, trail the rest with the 10-day moving average.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"The best setups, the ones that make the biggest moves are very clean in the way they act.",Kristjan Kullamägi
It doesn’t matter if you get shaken out due to an algo or not. You should always obey your stops.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"If you get the big stuff right, you don’t have to worry about the little stuff.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"If I get stopped out, I get stopped out. I don’t think. I just get out.",Kristjan Kullamägi
"If it’s a good setup, you have to get back in. Even if that means you have to buy it higher.",Kristjan Kullamägi
The big moves take weeks and months to play out.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"When you let the price action dictate, you don’t have to think.",Kristjan Kullamägi
You need the strongest stocks. You don’t have an edge trading random stocks. It has to be a momentum leader,Kristjan Kullamägi
Tune out all the media. Tune out all the news. They’re not going to help you at all.,Kristjan Kullamägi
Earnings are fuel. You need fuel and a reason for something to go up. Stocks don’t go up because of a pattern.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"You have to adapt. What has worked a couple of weeks, months, and years ago may not work in the next couple of weeks, months, and years.",Kristjan Kullamägi
I only use hard stops when the price is close to my stop area.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"You can get trading ideas from a book or trading concepts from a book. But the only you learn is to learn the lessons from yourself, from the pain of doing the wrong thing.",Kristjan Kullamägi
Focus on tight setups on volatile stocks.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"It’s never a discipline problem, it’s a confidence problem because you haven’t put in enough effort. If you study enough examples of a certain setup, you’ll build confidence.",Kristjan Kullamägi
You want to see tightness before a breakout.,Kristjan Kullamägi
It’s fine to sit in cash for months. Patience will make you millions.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"When I take a trade on the short side, I want at least a 1:5 risk-to-reward ratio. On the long side, I want ten times my risk",Kristjan Kullamägi
The only way to be in the big winners is to have some kind of trailing stop.,Kristjan Kullamägi
"Study four or five different setups. Then, you only need to master one to make tens of millions.",Kristjan Kullamägi

"There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it.'",Jesse Livermore
"We talk about these patterns all the time. It's a high tight flag. Just by being able to identify this, you're going to be able to outperform 99% of PhDs in the world. You're set for life. It's the same pattern over and over again",Qullamaggie
"They [patterns] happen on the weekly, they happen on the 60 min, they happen on the daily, they happen on the 5 min. Choose your timeframe.",Qullamaggie
"If you only identify one pattern, it needs to be the high tight flag. The stocks with the most momentum, that go sideways and start surfing the 10 or 20 day.",Qullamaggie
You need to maximize the opportunities when things are good and step back when things are not so good.,Qullamaggie
"I want to see higher lows, tightening ranges, and relative strength, cut 99% of things that don’t matter and your trading results will improve",Qullamaggie
"Look, at the end of the day, if the market is going up, if stocks are going up, your job is to be long. Once the moving averages turn and your stocks fall below the 10 and 20, your job is to be in cash. It's not more difficult than that. Focus on what you can control. Everything else is just noise",Qullamaggie
"Now and then you're gonna catch these stocks that double and triple in a short amount of time. Those are the ones that are gonna make you rich. Everything else is just a grind. You gotta find those homeruns. Most of the time trading is just a grind - 70, 80% of the time.",Qullamaggie
"My win rate last year (2020), and I had insane returns, was only 35%. The year before that in 2019 it was only 25%. You have to get used to getting stopped out a lot. Many times the same day and many times within a few minutes. That’s the name of the game.",Qullamaggie
"Most of my trading happens in the first, say, 30 or 45 mins. Like 70-80% happens in the first 10% of the trading day.",Qullamaggie
"Guys, all of you should really invest in yourselves, if you wanna make millions, you really need to put in the work. You can’t sit there and follow other people, it’s fine to ask for advice but you should go back, like what I did. I went to tc2000, this was 6-7 years ago when I started my market research project, I went to US Common stocks, I went through all of these stocks. Just pull up the monthly chart, went back as far as I could, looked at all the big moves, every stock that went up at least a few hundred% in a short amount of time, or thousands of percent over a period of years, I just put them in a watchlist, then I went through. I looked at price action, news, earnings.",Qullamaggie
"People bitch and moan that there is too much content. Are you fucking kidding me? When I found Pradeep in 2011, he has a free blog where he has posted since 2005, I went through every single post, then I signed up for his paid site and went through every single post he made since inception which was 6 years. When I found Minervini I read his books, signed up for his paid site, went through every single tweet he has every tweeted, and looked for setups and his entries. When I found Dan Zanger I signed up for his paid site and went through every single newsletter till inception late 90s, trying to understand his method, what he trades, how he trades, trying to understand everything about his method. So when someone writes to me, 'Hey I signed up for this site there’s so much content idk where to begin' STFU. Thats what I think about bitchers and moaners asking for shortcuts.",Qullamaggie
"As much time as I've put in, there's always someone doing more. That, someone, was Qullamaggie - We were both in Stockbee while trying to figure it out. I worked hard but his work ethic was insane. I've done really well - he's become a legend",Scot1andT on twitter

"No substitute for going in depth and studying traders, setups, and markets",Qullamaggie
The biggest drawdowns always happen after big runs. If you dont have a drawdown that means you aren't taking any risk and not making any money.,Qullamaggie
If a stock gaps up with massive volume and breaks the opening range highs you better pay attention,Qullamaggie
Markets only trend 1/3 of the time,Qullamaggie
Need to get feelings out of your trading so you dont randomly sell things,Qullamaggie
If you sell stuff too early in a hot market then you retire 10 years later,Qullamaggie
Spot opportunity when the market is having a down day. Market tells you what stocks wants to go up and they will yell at you. You have to listen to the market,Qullamaggie
An edge is being able to shut off when market is closed and be complete focused when the market is open,Qullamaggie
Its the same cycle over and over again. Same patterns over again just different players but the game doesn't change,Qullamaggie
Never just sell everything into strength. Better to sell 10% to late than to early,Qullamaggie

Breakout edge never goes out of favor but you need a good market that is trending,Qullamaggie
Open mind is important and go to where the money is going. Always be flexible,Qullamaggie
Way easier to make money on the long side. No reason to be a short seller. Markets are driven by momentum. Shorting and researching shorts is such a waste of time,Qullamaggie
Biggest problem people make is they think too much. Solid plan and setups and think less. Will be way more profitable,Qullamaggie

Don't listen to the idiots on TV or on media that says 'oh this is unprecedented', whatever blah blah yadda yadda, it's not, it's always the same things happening over and over again.
